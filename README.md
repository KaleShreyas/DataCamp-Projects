## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.
#### Project Description
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. 
Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

Project Tasks
1. Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis
2. The alarming number of deaths
3. Death at the clinics
4. The handwashing begins
5. The effect of handwashing
6. The effect of handwashing highlighted
7. More handwashing, fewer deaths?
8. A Bootstrap analysis of Semmelweis handwashing data
9. The fate of Dr. Semmelweis

## Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.
#### Project Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. 
Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval

Project Tasks
1. Credit card applications
2. Inspecting the applications
3. Handling the missing values (part i)
4. Handling the missing values (part ii)
5. Handling the missing values (part iii)
6. Preprocessing the data (part i)
7. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
8. Preprocessing the data (part ii)
9. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
10. Making predictions and evaluating performance
11. Grid searching and making the model perform better
12. Finding the best performing model

## Modeling the Volatility of US Bond Yields
Discover how the US bond yields behave using descriptive statistics and advanced modeling.
#### Project Description
In this project, we will explore the volatility structure of US Government Bond Yields. Essentially all financial assets exhibit a phenomenon called volatility clustering where low and high volatility regimes follow each other. The alternating volatility regimes are a focus for risk management and investment decisions. We will use the well-known GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) method to explore the statistical properties of financial time series data.

This project assumes background knowledge on time series analysis, GARCH modeling, plotting and uses packages xts and rugarch.

The historical yield data are published by the US Federal Reserve Data Releases and imported from Quandl, https://www.quandl.com/data/FED/SVENY,

Project Tasks
1. Volatility changes over time
2. Plotting the evolution of bond yields
3. Make the difference
4. The US yields are no exceptions, but maturity matters
5. Let's dive into some statistics
6. GARCH in action
7. Fitting the 20-year maturity
8. What about the distributions? (Part 1)
9. What about the distributions? (Part 2)
10. A final quiz

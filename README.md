## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.
#### Project Description
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. 
Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

## Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.
#### Project Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. 
Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval

## Modeling the Volatility of US Bond Yields
Discover how the US bond yields behave using descriptive statistics and advanced modeling.
#### Project Description
In this project, we will explore the volatility structure of US Government Bond Yields. Essentially all financial assets exhibit a phenomenon called volatility clustering where low and high volatility regimes follow each other. The alternating volatility regimes are a focus for risk management and investment decisions. We will use the well-known GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) method to explore the statistical properties of financial time series data.

This project assumes background knowledge on time series analysis, GARCH modeling, plotting and uses packages xts and rugarch.

The historical yield data are published by the US Federal Reserve Data Releases and imported from Quandl, https://www.quandl.com/data/FED/SVENY,

## Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio
Use pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.
#### Project Description
When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.

In this project, you will apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas.

## Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?
Play bank data scientist and use regression discontinuity to see which debts are worth collecting.
#### Project Description
After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank simply walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. In this project, you will look at a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. The goal for the data scientist is to determine in this non-random assignment whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.

## The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning
Use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.
#### Project Description
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, you will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. 
The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

## Extract Stock Sentiment from News Headlines
Scrape news headlines for FB and TSLA then apply sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.
#### Project Description
In this project, you will generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. 
Using this natural language processing technique, you will understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
